# Scheme Name: Trusted Digital Identity: Certified B Corporation

## Overview

This scheme applies to any Certified B Corporation wishing to become certified as an issuer of trusted digital identies primarily for use within their own business processes.

## Certificate Sub-Scope: Trusted Digital Identity

* This scheme intended to applied in conjunction with the national standard [**CAN/CIOSC 103-1: Digital Trust and Identity**](./standard/103-1-2023/) (this link is to a github folder) .
* This sub-scope is based on lessons-learned and knowledge gained through the [**Public Sector Profile of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework Version 1.4**](https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP/tree/master/Version1_4). Material is being used under the [Open Government License](https://open.canada.ca/en/open-government-licence-canada)
* This sub-scope embraces the principles intentions 

* A **trusted digital identity** (TDI)is an electronic representation of a person, used exclusively by that same person to receive valued services and to carry out transactions with trust and confidence. A TDI may be accepted in accordance with:

  * relevant legislation/regulations
  * applicable standards,
  * conformity assessment schemes (this scheme),
  * trust frameworks,
  * mutual recognition agreements

## Certification Focus / Specialization: Certified B Corporation

A [Certified B Corporation](https://www.bcorporation.net/en-us/certification/) (B Corp) is a designation for for-profit companies that meet rigorous social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency standards.

A B Corp aligned with its commitment to transparency, accountability, and ethical business practices, is expected to utilize a trusted digital identity to foster secure and respectful interactions online. By leveraging a verified digital identity system, the B Corp ensures that its online transactions and communications are both genuine and protect stakeholders' information. This should align with the B Corp's broader principles of safeguarding the interests of the community, employees, and environment, while also emphasizing security, privacy, and trust in the digital realm. Such an approach not only promotes ethical digital practices but also enhances stakeholder confidence in the company's online activities.

## Assessment Scheme Overview

This assessment scheme:

* is intended to be used in conjunction with, but not limited to, **accredited conformity assessment bodies and standards**.
* is **technology-agnostic** and defined in a manner to allow for the **impartial assessment** of different platforms, services, architectures, and technologies. As such, this scheme does not recommend one technology solution over another.  
* **does not confer authority** and is intended to work with **existing legal, policy and governance frameworks**.
* may be be applied in other contexts (international, domestic, etc.)
* has been designed so that **tailoring** is approriate for different contexts.

## Certificate Grant

### Accreditation

This assessment scheme may be used to grant certificates by conformity assesment bodies accredited in accordance with the following standards:

* ISO 17021
* ISO 17029

### Other Applications

This assessment scheme may be used to support the following activities:

* Readiness Assessment
* Program Design

### Specialization and Focus

* The sub-scope of the conformity assessment scheme and its application may be further **restricted** to assess a specialized service or program in relation to assessing a the provision of attributes related **trusted digital identity** only,or

* The sub-scope of the conformity assessment scheme and its application may be **broadened** to assesss a service or program in relation to assess the provision of additional attributes, required for the purposes of **eligibility** (beyond the strict defintion of *trusted digital identity*). Examples of additional attributes may include, *citizenship*, *residential* *address*, *health* *status*, *income* *level*, *professional* *qualifications*, etc.

* The sub-scope of the conformity assessment and its application may be **tailored** to assess a service or program with a specific applicability but having having the key components of digital trust and identity. An example would be a **trusted account** that is offered in conjunction with providing healthcare.

In all cases, scope and application must be agreed on and documented at the beginning of the assesment enagement.

## Caveats

The assessment scheme may be limited or restricted in scope to one or all the following:

* **Persons**: all citizens and residents of a jurisdiction (including deceased persons) for whom an identity has been established within a jurisdiction.
* **Organizations**: all organizations registered within a jurisdiction (including inactive organizations) for which an identity has been established within that jurisdiction; and/or,
* **Relationships**: of persons to persons, organizations to organizations, and persons to organizations.

.This is detailed in the [Scheme Manual](./scheme/scheme-manual.md) currently under development.

## Stakeholders and Users

**Stakeholders** include, but are not limited to

* Any Certified B Corporation wishing to become certified as an issuer of trusted digital identies primarily for use within their own business processes.
* Business owners and program managers – to enable identity solutions in order to achieve business objectives or program outcomes.
* Regulatory and oversight bodies – to understand the implications on their role in the digital ecosystem; and
* Digital Identity technology and service providers – to understand where they fit in the digital ecosystem and to help define requirements for their products and services.

**Users** include but are not limited to:

* **Relying Parties** who are accountable to providing high-value services to individuals and organizations in a **safe, secure, and inclusive** manner.

## Background

### Strategic Need

There is no standardized way to present and consume identity information online and in-person with trust and confidence, while respecting the rights of individuals, including their privacy. Many existing online systems are morphing into interconnected, ad hoc and non-standard authentication and identity systems, which can be easily exploited by the criminal element and which
can result in non-optimal balances between users, relying parties and authoritative parties. As one example, compromised username and password combinations used across several services purportedly by the same user may have devastating impacts, from credit card fraud and mobile device deactivations to compromise of, and re-use of online personal information and related data

Accessible, inclusive and efficient service delivery across all channels and sectors of the economy relies heavily on the input of a trusted digital identity, i.e., an ability to confirm you are whom you say you are. While identity and risk can be largely mitigated by default in the physical world through closed and fragmented systems and established standards and regulatory safeguards (and the fact that such risks are now largely tolerated and ‘priced’), compensating systems, standards, mitigation strategies and regulatory oversight do not yet exist in the online world. And in the online world, risk is multiplied both by velocity and distributed relationships and accordingly the potential impact of adverse incidentsrelated to a single compromise – or worse material compromises – can be exponential and broadly disseminated.

There is a general realization that traditional document-based authentication processes and oversight rules for identity must evolve and adapt to support a shift to the use of identity sources for digital services. A formal methodology does not exist to assess identity and credential risk, nor a trust mechanism or regulatory oversight to enable the digital federation of identity. In the absence of a standard, public and private sector organizations continue to rely on organization-specific, vendor driven and ad-hoc document-based identity management processes, impacting integrity, security, privacy, trust, and service delivery. The formal methodology should balance the myriad of tensions involved – legal, technical, remedial etc. with the intent that the resulting digital federation should provide a foundation of trust for all – a foundation that can be evolved over time independent of the technology and relationships of the day while supporting the innovation and service enhancement that will characterize the Canadian digital economy.

This National Standard of Canada will:

* define a set of controls and procedures to help protect Canadians transacting in both the Public and Private sectors;
* support future certification programs developed at national, regional and international levels;
* be maintained on a periodic basis as determined by the technical committee responsible for developing the standard.

### Trade

Having a trusted digital identity standard and federation rules will propel Canada to the forefront of
global digital economies. This standard will form the policy foundation of a new digital economy - formalizing the chain of trust across jurisdictions, users and both Public and Private sector organizations. It will allow participants to rely upon the assurance provided by another and allow individuals to transact with these organizations with trust and confidence. In addition, given the rapid escalation in cyber mischief and malicious practices from both public and private sector actors globally, it is important to put stakes in the ground to guide the well-intentioned, and potentially sanction those with other motives. A standard is an effective mechanism for demonstrating compliance with processes (actions and behaviours) a community agrees are important. Broad adoption of the standard will reduce uncertainty and therefore can encourage entrepreneurship and investment, as well as advance trade.
